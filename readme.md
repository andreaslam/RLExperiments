A Temporal Difference Learning Agent Powered by [Farama Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)

## About this Project
This project aims to explore the potentials of bootstrapped [Temporal Difference learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning) (TD) using Farama, basing the experiments primarily off [CartPole-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) although the code is flexible and can be used in other deterministic games with discrete action space.
